# Working_Capital_Optimization

The code is designed to analyze and predict financial metrics related to Accounts Payable (AP) and Accounts Receivable (AR), enabling better cash flow management, vendor relationship optimization, and working capital analysis. By leveraging machine learning (Gradient Boosting) to predict payment behaviors and aggregating financial data by week, the code provides actionable insights into when payments are likely to occur, whether invoices will be paid on time, and the overall financial health of the company.

Key components of the code include:

Data Exploration and Visualization: It visualizes distributions of invoice amounts, overdue days, and payment behaviors, helping identify trends and patterns in the financial data.

Payment Behavior Prediction: The model predicts whether payments will be made early, on time, or late, based on historical data, providing accurate forecasts of payment timing.

Working Capital Calculation: It calculates the weekly working capital by comparing total open amounts (AR) and invoice amounts (AP), offering insights into the company’s ability to meet short-term financial obligations.

Performance Evaluation: The model’s performance is assessed using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE), ensuring the predictions are reliable.

Financial Insights for Decision Making: By merging predictions with actual data, the code provides a comprehensive view of expected payment timings and working capital, which is crucial for strategic financial planning.

The code ultimately enhances financial forecasting, enables proactive vendor management, and supports informed decision-making by providing a clear view of liquidity needs, payment behaviors, and financial health trends.
